                Hello! I'm Jerome Hernandez, an enthusiastic IT student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. From a young age, I've been captivated by the ever-evolving world of computers and software development. Currently pursuing my degree in IT, I am dedicated to honing my skills and knowledge in various programming languages and technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can leverage my creativity and analytical mindset to tackle complex challenges. Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring new coding projects, diving into the latest tech trends, and engaging in community-driven initiatives. My ultimate goal is to transition into a role as a developer/programmer, where I can contribute meaningfully to innovative projects and make a positive impact in the tech industry.
